He did not want to compromise with his domestic enemies and wanted to prove to Mexico's elite and American interests that he was the only viable alternative to anarchy and radicalism. In March 1919, General González ordered his subordinate Guajardo to attack the Zapatistas, but when González discovered Guajardo in a cantina, he had him arrested. Zapata attempted to send a note to Guajardo inviting him to switch sides, but the note ended up in González's hands. González used this note to his advantage, accusing Guajardo of being a traitor and reducing him to tears. González convinced Guajardo to feign a defection to Zapata to recover from the disgrace. Guajardo and Zapata corresponded and planned a mutiny. On April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, but instead, he had him killed. Zapata's body was photographed, displayed publicly, and then buried. Carranza did not bring Zapata's body to the capital, but his clothing was displayed there."

The U.S. government claimed that Zarqawi received medical treatment in Baghdad, Iraq, from March to May 2002. Jordanian authorities requested his extradition from Iraq for his suspected involvement in a terrorist plot in 1999. However, reports vary on Zarqawi's location during the summer of 2002, with Jordanian court documents suggesting he trained fighters in Syria, where they allegedly killed a U.S. administrator. Some Arab intelligence sources claimed Zarqawi remained in Syria, while the U.S. contended that he was in Baghdad until November 2002, before fleeing to Iran and northeastern Iraq."

He criticized the ruling UDF government and former members of his party involved in embezzlement.

7f3be055e20d5ce6417f8c13b63f34ce,Émile_Zola,Carbon monoxide poisoning caused by blocked chimney.,"Emile Zola died on September 29, 1902 from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a poorly ventilated chimney. His funeral was attended by thousands, including Alfred Dreyfus. Zola had just completed a novel about the Dreyfus trial, and a sequel was planned but never finished. Some blamed Zola's enemies for his death, but it could not be proven at the time. Many people expressed sympathy and visited Zola's house to pay their respects. However, his enemies celebrated his death. Henri Rochefort claimed that Zola had committed suicide after discovering Dreyfus was guilty. Zola was initially buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre but was later moved to the Panthéon. During the ceremony, there was an assassination attempt on Dreyfus. In 1953, a journalist raised the possibility that Zola's death was a murder, based on claims from a pharmacist and chimney-sweep. Literary historian Alain Pagès believes that this is likely true, and Zola's great-granddaughters corroborate this explanation."

7fed2ec67fd50baaad935155735b9fda,Huldrych_Zwingli,Death in battle.,"After the failure of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli focused on forming alliances with Philip of Hesse. He negotiated with several cities and countries, but had little success. Meanwhile, Charles V invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views on faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession, while cities like Strasbourg and Constance presented the Tetrapolitan Confession. Zwingli produced his own confession, Fidei ratio, which was strongly anti-Catholic and anti-Lutheran. When Philip of Hesse formed the Schmalkaldic League, some cities joined based on a Lutheran interpretation of the Tetrapolitan Confession. Zürich, Basel, and Bern considered joining, but Zwingli couldn't reconcile the confession with his beliefs and severed relations with the League. The Burgrecht cities faced conflicts with the Five States and attempted different means of applying pressure, with Zürich advocating armed conflict. In October 1531, the Five States declared war on Zürich. Zürich's mobilization was slow and they suffered a defeat in the Battle of Kappel, where Zwingli was among the casualties. He was seen by Luther and Erasmus as a threat to their beliefs, and his death was viewed as a judgment from God."

The Spirits Act of 1860 allowed for the blending of grain whiskies with malt whiskies, leading to the rise of blended Scotch whisky, which was lighter and sweeter and appealed to a wider audience. Alec Walker introduced the brand's square bottle in 1860, making it more convenient for storage and transportation. The label was also placed at an angle of 24 degrees upwards left to right, making it more visible and recognizable from a distance. The arrival of a railway in Kilmarnock, where the brand was produced, boosted sales as it facilitated the transportation of goods to merchant ships. Alec created Johnnie Walker's first commercial blend in 1865 and named it Old Highland Whisky. By the time Alexander Walker II inherited the company, whisky sales accounted for a significant portion of the firm's income."

Walker's body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony. A documentary about his life titled I Am Paul Walker was released in 2018."

854902657e324d80d7ca3f7489328c96,Raoul_Wallenberg,Unknown,"This text discusses the various evidence and testimonies surrounding the fate of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. On 6 February 1957, the Soviet government released a document stating that Wallenberg had died in his prison cell in 1947, potentially due to a heart attack. However, there have been conflicting reports and theories about his death. In 1991, an investigation concluded that Wallenberg was executed in Lubyanka prison, possibly through poison. In 2000, a statement by Alexander Yakovlev, a former Soviet official, claimed that Wallenberg had been shot. Additional evidence supporting his execution came to light in 2016 with the discovery of KGB head Ivan Serov's diary. Despite the new information, Wallenberg was posthumously rehabilitated in 2000 by the Russian prosecutor. His personal belongings were returned to his family in 1989, and files related to his case were given to the Russian government in 2007. These items are now displayed at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow."

Initially skeptical of the role of women as propagandists, she was convinced by her friends to use her talents for the patriot cause. Her writings were influenced by contemporary literature and sought to provide moral lessons. While not read for factual details, her works are considered valuable in understanding the mood of the Revolutionary era and early nation. Debate exists among feminists regarding her inclusion in their movement, as she held traditional views on women's roles but also encouraged women writers. Despite her desire to retire from political commentary, the public continued to seek her opinions. Mercy Warren was honored by having a Liberty ship named after her and being inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Her great-great-grandson, Charles Warren, went on to become a notable lawyer and historian."

The exact cause of her death is debated, with some suggesting it was an act of solidarity with war victims and others attributing it to her study of Arthur Schopenhauer's teachings on self-starvation. However, one biographer believes the coroner's report was mistaken and claims that Weil asked for food during her time in the hospital. Another biographer suggests that her death was a result of her compassion for the suffering in France and her deep devotion to Christ. Ultimately, her death is seen as an act of love."

Williams had expressed in his will that he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys.

Eventually, the elder daughter dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a trust fund left by Williams be equally distributed among the three children.

During this time, De Witt, the Grand Pensionary, was severely wounded by an assassin and resigned from his position. His brother Cornelis, who was arrested on false charges of treason, was tortured and sentenced to exile. Both brothers were later attacked and killed by the Orangist mob. The lynching of the De Witts further fueled mob attacks and led to the empowerment of William, who was granted the authority to restore public order by purging city councils. The purges were accompanied by peaceful Orangist demonstrations that demanded the restoration of guild and civic militia privileges, greater influence for Calvinist preachers, and a roll-back on the toleration of Catholics and dissenting denominations. The new Orangist regime of William was well-established during his reign, although his exact role in the murder of the De Witt brothers remains uncertain. The political turmoil prevented the allies from finishing off the Republic, as the French were hindered by the water defenses and their incursion on frozen inundations almost ended in disaster. The States General managed to form alliances with the German emperor and Brandenburg, which relieved the French pressure in the East."

Four of his former students, including Elizabeth Anscombe and Yorick Smythies, were with him during his final moments. At Wittgenstein's request, a Dominican friar named Father Conrad Pepler attended his bedside. Wittgenstein was given a Catholic burial in Cambridge.

He began work on his autobiography in 1962 and wrote his final fiction, ""Basil Seal Rides Again."" This book was regarded as ""nasty."" However, in the same year, he received the title Companion of Literature from the Royal Society of Literature. His autobiography, ""A Little Learning,"" was published in 1964, and he wrote appreciatively about Pope John XXIII upon his death in 1963.

6b4a624d71f4dcfb1528a97df611d908,Jackie_Wilson,Pneumonia,"On September 29, 1975, Jackie Wilson suffered a massive heart attack while performing on stage. Audience members initially thought it was part of the act, but Dick Clark realized something was wrong and stopped the music. Cornell Gunter of the Coasters resuscitated Wilson, who was then rushed to the hospital. Wilson had a habit of sweating profusely during performances, and would consume a large amount of salt and water to induce the effect. This high salt consumption may have contributed to his heart disease. The lack of oxygen during the heart attack caused Wilson to slip into a coma, and although he briefly recovered in early 1976, he soon slipped back into a semi-comatose state. A benefit was held to raise funds for Wilson's medical expenses, with Elvis Presley covering a large portion of the bills. Wilson passed away on January 21, 1984, at the age of 49 from complications of pneumonia. He was initially buried in an unmarked grave, but in 1987, a mausoleum was purchased using funds raised by fans, and Wilson and his mother were interred there."

The autopsy showed that Wood had a blood alcohol content of 0.14% and traces of motion-sickness medication and painkillers in her system. The cause of death was ruled accidental drowning and hypothermia. However, her sister expressed doubts and claimed that Wood was terrified of water and wouldn't have left the yacht on her own. In 2011, the case was reopened after the boat captain stated that he had previously lied to the police and that Wagner was responsible for Wood's death. The investigation named Wagner as a person of interest. In 2012, the cause of death on Wood's death certificate was changed to ""drowning and other undetermined factors."" The case remains unresolved, with questions surrounding the circumstances of her death and the possibility of foul play."

Williams had a lifestyle involving drug use and abuse that led to legal trouble. In the 1970s, his drug abuse and violence began to take a toll on him. He even threatened Little Richard with a gun over a drug debt, but eventually showed compassion for his friend. This incident and other factors led to Little Richard's return to born-again Christianity. Williams was married but became estranged from his wife. He was found dead by his mother in his Los Angeles home in 1980, with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled as suicide, but there were speculations that he may have been murdered due to his involvement in drugs and prostitution. No suspects were arrested or charged. Williams was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California."

He died in 1979 after fracturing his pelvis in a fall. Tiomkin composed close to a rate of one film per month in the 1950s and was the highest-paid film composer of that time. He composed 57 film scores between 1948 and 1958, and his most famous work includes the scores for films like High Noon, for which he won two Academy Awards. He was honored in the Soviet Union and Russia and served as a jury member at the Moscow International Film Festival in 1967. Tiomkin was the first film score composer to write both the theme song and the score. His use of theme songs in many of his films had a significant impact on Hollywood in the following decades. Tiomkin's work often included ""source music"" that was believed to be influenced by Russian folk songs, and he was known for creating grand American theme music by combining the styles of European classical composers and American folk music. Some of his film scores were released on LP soundtrack albums, and he has been recognized by the US Postal Service with a stamp in their ""Hollywood Composers"" series.

bbb36c411d35528f695bfcdc2f537643,Rudolf_Steiner,Rudolf Steiner - Cause of death: illness,"This text discusses the relationship between Rudolf Steiner, founder of anthroposophy, and the Nazi regime in Germany. It mentions that Steiner was attacked by members of the National Socialist German Workers Party, who accused him of being a tool of the Jews. Steiner warned against the disastrous effects of the Nazis coming to power, and he faced threats and disruptions in his lectures. After his death, there were attacks on his thought and anthroposophy by Nazi leaders, who criticized his ideology as incompatible with Nazi racial ideology. However, there were also supporters of anthroposophy within the Nazi regime, including Rudolf Hess, who was a patron of anthroposophy and defender of Steiner's biodynamic agriculture. Overall, the relationship between anthroposophy and the Nazi regime was complex, with some factions opposing it and others allowing it to exist."

This was largely due to the publication of a book by Barry Lynes in 1987, which claimed that Rife had successfully cured cancer but that his work was suppressed by a conspiracy led by the American Medical Association. The American Cancer Society dismisses these claims as implausible and criticizes the book for its style and lack of verifiable evidence. After the book's publication, various devices bearing Rife's name were marketed as cures for cancer and other diseases. However, these devices were found to be ineffective and often sold with grandiose claims. In some cases, cancer patients who used these devices instead of conventional therapy died. There have been several cases of health fraud and convictions related to the sale of Rife devices. Rife machines are now considered pseudomedicine by mainstream experts and their use has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients in Australia."

The resurrection is not a return to earthly life but signifies God the Father's affirmation of all that Jesus taught and represented. It is through the resurrection that Jesus is vindicated and established as the absolute Savior. His life and death are seen as the cause of God's salvific will, opening the door to our salvation. Jesus of Nazareth is thus understood as the God-Man, the ultimate savior."

Her work gave her insight into the struggles of women in the region, further reinforcing her belief in the need for women's suffrage. She was elected to the Manchester School Board and reopened her store for extra income. The Pankhurst children all became involved in the suffrage movement, with Christabel becoming her mother's favorite and eventually joining her in speaking events. Sylvia pursued art studies, while the younger children, Adela and Harry, faced difficulties in their studies."

4ef3362ba787da22ea03d6d2914cb4ca,John_Steinbeck,John Steinbeck died from heart disease and congestive heart failure during the 1968 flu pandemic.,"John Steinbeck, the American author, died on December 20, 1968, at the age of 66 in New York City. He died from heart disease and congestive heart failure, which was exacerbated by his lifelong smoking habit. An autopsy revealed that his main coronary arteries were almost completely blocked. Steinbeck's body was cremated and interred in Salinas, California, alongside his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was also buried there in 2004. Before his death, Steinbeck expressed belief that his physical death would be the final end to his life. In 1976, his incomplete novel based on King Arthur legends, called The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights, was published. Many of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools, although some have faced controversy and bans due to profanity and racial slurs. The Grapes of Wrath, his most well-known novel, has been banned and burned in certain locations. Overall, Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, according to the American Library Association."

Snider had purchased a shotgun the day before and made several morbid remarks about Playmates who had died unexpectedly. Stratten had come to the house to discuss their divorce settlement and had brought cash as a down payment. Her business manager suggested she hand off the negotiations to her lawyer, but she insisted on dealing with Snider personally, saying she wanted to remain his friend. Later that evening, Snider's two roommates returned home and saw Stratten's car parked out front. Assuming the couple had reconciled, they watched television in the living room. They discovered the bodies of Stratten and Snider the next day after being alerted by Snider's private detective. Both had been killed by a single blast from Snider's shotgun, and their bodies were found nude. It is believed that Snider shot Stratten shortly after her arrival and then committed suicide about an hour later. Stratten's death was devastating to her friends and family, and she was buried in Los Angeles with an epitaph chosen by her boyfriend, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. Three years later, Mariel Hemingway played Stratten in a biopic about her life."

In the 1940s and 1950s, English professors moved away from Parrington's approach and focused more on the texts themselves rather than the social and political contexts that interested him. Historians also shifted to a consensus model of the past, considering Parrington's liberal and conservative views to be naive. During the 1950s, his book lost popularity and scholars ignored it. However, some still admired Parrington's politically committed writing style. The Parrington Oval at the University of Oklahoma and Parrington Hall at the University of Washington are named after Parrington."

ffafd8b75606bd0303c555566af3f5cb,Ruben_Salazar,Cause of death: Shot with tear gas projectile.,"Ruben Salazar, a prominent member of the Los Angeles Chicano community, was killed on August 29, 1970, during the National Chicano Moratorium March protesting the Vietnam War. Salazar was resting in a bar when he was struck in the head by a tear gas round fired by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The incident sparked panic and rioting. Although an inquest ruled the shooting as ""death at the hands of another,"" the deputy responsible was never prosecuted. Many believed it was a premeditated assassination. The riots started when a fight broke out between deputies and people stealing from a liquor store near the protest. Cadets from the Sheriff's Academy were also involved in a fight, leading to more rioting. Salazar's killing was covered by journalist Hunter S. Thompson in Rolling Stone magazine. A report released in 2011 stated that there was no evidence deputies intentionally targeted Salazar. However, a settlement of $700,000 was reached with Salazar's family due to the sheriff's department's improper use of force during the march. Salazar was survived by his wife and children."

7fdace08efa9fcf1bda4663998589c2a,Miguel_de_Unamuno,Inhalation of gases,"On December 31, 1936, the Spanish writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno died while under house arrest in Salamanca. It is believed that he inhaled gases from a brazier during a one-hour interview with a visitor. A theory presented in a 2020 book by Colette Rabaté and Jean-Claude Rabaté suggests that Unamuno may have been murdered by Bartolomé Aragón, the last person to visit him. The theory is based on Aragón falsely claiming to have been a former student of Unamuno, as well as his fascist beliefs and previous collaboration with Nationalist propaganda. However, the authors of the book did not defend this theory since there is no new evidence to support it. Nevertheless, it is known that Aragón and Unamuno had a previous intellectual relationship. Other suspicious details include the lack of an autopsy, despite the cause of death being determined as a sudden intracranial bleeding, the maid hearing two screams from Unamuno during Aragón's visit, and discrepancies in the reported time of death."

Tecumseh pleads with Procter to stay and fight, but Procter insists on retreating to Chatham. Tecumseh reluctantly agrees and leads a rearguard action at Chatham before discovering that Procter had retreated further upriver.

At the time of his death, he had an estimated net worth of $105 million. In his will, he left the majority of his estate, 95%, to his son William and four grandsons. This left his other living son and nine daughters with relatively small inheritances. Some of his children contested the will, claiming that he was not of sound mind when it was drawn up. They alleged that William and a corrupt spiritualist had influenced Vanderbilt. To avoid public humiliation, William eventually settled with his siblings, providing them with additional compensation. The will allocated varying amounts to his daughters, with his wife receiving $500,000 and their New York City home. His surviving son, whom he considered a wastrel, received income from a trust fund. Overall, the inheritances, although smaller in comparison to William's, made his daughters and Cornelius wealthy by the standards of the time and were not subject to inheritance tax."

Rappe allegedly suffered a trauma during the party and died four days later from a ruptured bladder and secondary peritonitis. The exact events of the party are unclear, with different witnesses giving varying accounts. Some alleged that Rappe died as a result of a violent sexual assault by Arbuckle, but his accuser had a criminal record for extortion and prostitution. Other witnesses testified that Rappe had pre-existing health conditions such as cystitis and venereal disease, suggesting that her death may have been caused by her health rather than an assault. Arbuckle was tried for manslaughter three times and was eventually acquitted, but his reputation and career were ruined as a result of the scandal."

He argued for capital punishment based on the principles of deterrence and punishment for severe criminals. He believed that the primary role of government was to establish legal order and enforce laws. Van den Haag disputed the notion that capital punishment was only about retribution, stating that it was necessary to maintain legal order and justice. He also argued that making crimes as disadvantageous as possible would decrease their occurrence, using economic concepts like opportunity cost to support this idea. He related Marxist theory to his justification of the death penalty, claiming that punishment should be distributed equally among violators to deter crime. Van den Haag also believed that the death penalty was necessary for permanent incapacitation of offenders and as a way to lower the crime rate. He considered homicide to be the most deplorable crime and argued that capital punishment could decrease murders. He rejected rehabilitation as a response to those who commit murder, stating that it is ineffective and only works after the crime has occurred. Overall, van den Haag believed the death penalty should exist to protect innocent lives, even though he recognized the risk of executing innocent people."

Hitler took advantage of Hindenburg's impending death to pass a law that abolished the presidency and consolidated his power as the absolute dictator of Germany. Hitler had known since April 1934 that Hindenburg was unlikely to survive the year, and he worked to gain the support of the armed forces to succeed him. After Hindenburg's death, Hitler became both head of state and head of government, solidifying his position as the Führer. There are also allegations that Hindenburg's last will and testament criticized the Nazis and supported democracy, but Hitler's version of the testament was complimentary of him. A plebiscite was held in which the German people approved Hitler taking the office of Führer. These actions violated the Enabling Act, and the constitution had previously been amended to establish the president of the High Court of Justice as the successor to the presidency. Hindenburg was interred with his wife in a ceremony at the Tannenberg Memorial, but the memorial was destroyed during World War II. Hindenburg's remains were later moved and currently rest in St. Elizabeth's Church in Marburg. The plaque on his grave commemorates the victims of war and violence, but does not mention Hindenburg's name."

William Law and Robert Foster disagreed with Smith about managing Nauvoo's economy and accused him of proposing marriage to their wives. Smith believed these men were plotting against him and excommunicated them. Law and Foster formed a competing ""reform church"" and got indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy. They published the Nauvoo Expositor, criticizing Smith's theocratic aspirations, polygamy, and using religion to seduce and marry women. The Nauvoo city council declared the newspaper a public nuisance and ordered its destruction. This provoked a call to arms from Thomas C. Sharp, prompting Smith to mobilize the Nauvoo Legion and declare martial law. Governor Ford intervened, and Smith fled but later returned and surrendered. He and his brother Hyrum were detained in Carthage Jail, where an armed mob stormed the jail and killed Hyrum. Smith fired shots before attempting to escape, but he was shot multiple times and died."

Schlick had stayed in Vienna while many other members of the Vienna Circle had left due to the rise of the Nazis. Nelböck confesses to the act and is detained, but shows no remorse. He uses the court proceedings as an opportunity to present his ideology, claiming that Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had interfered with his moral restraint. Another version suggests that Nelböck was motivated by jealousy and a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival. Despite not being Jewish, propaganda associates Schlick with the Jewish intelligentsia. After Austria is annexed by Nazi Germany, Nelböck is released on probation after serving only two years of his sentence."

4c30853cc5f0d1251fa0baa8e3cd64cc,Franz_Schubert,"The cause of death was officially diagnosed as typhoid fever, though other theories, including the tertiary stage of syphilis, have been proposed.","Franz Schubert's health deteriorated in the late 1820s, and he feared he was near death. He suffered from symptoms that matched mercury poisoning, possibly from syphilis treatment. In November 1828, he fell ill with headaches, fever, swollen joints, and vomiting, and his condition worsened. Five days before his death, a friend played Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14, which Schubert had wanted to hear. He died aged 31 on November 19, 1828, from typhoid fever, though there is speculation about syphilis being the cause. Some argue that his final illness was gastrointestinal rather than syphilis-related. Schubert was buried near Beethoven and later, both graves were moved to Zentralfriedhof. A memorial to Schubert was erected in Vienna's Stadtpark, and his former grave site is now a park called Schubert Park. His epitaph, written by poet Franz Grillparzer, commemorates his talent and unrealized potential."

It is believed that Villa's political enemies, Plutarco Elías Calles and President Alvaro Obregón, ordered the assassination. Villa was visiting Parral to pick up gold to pay his ranch staff when he was attacked. Nine bullets struck him in the head and upper chest, killing him instantly. Several of Villa's bodyguards and employees were also killed in the attack. The assassins fled but were later captured, although only two of them served a short time in jail. The assassination was likely motivated by Villa's desire to re-enter politics and the political uncertainty surrounding the upcoming 1924 elections. It has never been proven who was directly responsible for the assassination, but it is believed to have been a conspiracy involving Calles and his associate General Joaquín Amaro, with tacit approval from Obregón. A state legislator named Jesús Salas Barraza claimed sole responsibility for the plot but later implicated others in his confession. Salas Barraza received a commuted sentence and later became a colonel in the Mexican Army."

The cause of death was severe beating, being run over with his own car, and other acts of violence.","Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered on 2 November 1975 in Ostia. His body was found beaten, run over with his own car, and partially burned with gasoline. Initially, a 17-year-old named Giuseppe (Pino) Pelosi was convicted and sentenced to 9 years in prison, but he later retracted his confession, claiming it was made under the threat of violence. Pelosi said that three people with a Southern accent committed the murder. Evidence uncovered in 2005 suggested that Pasolini may have been killed by an extortionist, as some of the film rolls from his movie Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom had been stolen. A bloody wooden stick and an eyewitness account of a group of men pulling Pasolini from his car were also discovered. The case was reopened, but the new evidence was deemed insufficient to continue the investigation. In 2023, a plea was filed to reopen the case based on DNA analysis, linking the murder to the Banda della Magliana, a criminal organization with far-right ties."

He was pronounced dead later that day at the age of 54. Perry's funeral was held on November 3, 2023, and he was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

The song ""Don't Give Up"" by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, a song Perry loved and referenced in his autobiography, was played at the funeral. After his death, the National Philanthropic Trust established the ""Matthew Perry Foundation"" to support people suffering from addiction. On December 15, 2023, it was revealed that Perry's death was due to the acute effects of ketamine, with other factors such as the effects of buprenorphine, drowning, and coronary artery disease contributing to his death. Perry had been undergoing ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions to treat anxiety at the time of his death. The ketamine in his system at the time of death could not be from the therapy he was undergoing because the half-life of ketamine is much shorter than the time between his last session and his death."

However, Ruth began an affair with a married man named Henry Judd Gray in 1925. Ruth and Gray plotted to murder Albert, with Ruth persuading him to purchase a life insurance policy. They made several failed attempts to kill Albert before finally garroting him, stuffing his nose with chloroform-soaked rags, and beating him with a sash weight. They staged his death as a burglary, but police became suspicious due to inconsistencies in Ruth's story. A breakthrough came when police found a paper with the initials of Ruth's lover, causing Ruth to mention him for the first time. Gray was later caught and charged along with Ruth."

They encountered a severe thunderstorm over Brentwood, Tennessee, and the plane crashed. Contrary to rumors, Reeves was not flying the plane upside down. Eyewitnesses confirmed he was not upside down before the crash. Evidence suggests that Reeves turned left instead of right to avoid the storm, leading him further into the rain. As he tried to regain his ground references, he stalled the aircraft and made a fatal mistake by applying full power and pulling back on the yoke. The plane crashed a minute later. The wreckage was found 42 hours later, and Reeves and Manuel were pronounced dead. Thousands of people attended Reeves' funeral, and he was laid to rest near Carthage, Texas."

Bardo had been stalking Schaeffer for three years and had previously been obsessed with child peace activist Samantha Smith. He wrote numerous letters to Schaeffer, one of which she responded to. In 1987, Bardo tried to meet Schaeffer on the set of a show, but security turned him away. He lost interest in Schaeffer for a while and focused his obsession on other pop singers. However, when he watched Schaeffer in a movie and saw a scene in which she was in bed with another actor, he became enraged and decided she needed to be punished. Bardo paid a detective agency to find Schaeffer's home address and obtained a handgun from his brother. He traveled to Los Angeles, confirmed the address, and rang her doorbell. Schaeffer answered the door and had a brief conversation before asking Bardo not to come to her home again. He left and returned an hour later, shooting Schaeffer in the chest at point-blank range. She was rushed to a hospital but pronounced dead 30 minutes later. Schaeffer was buried in Portland, Oregon."

He was at his home with his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba, when they had an argument. Chiba locked herself in the bathroom and heard Smith scream. When she opened the door, she saw him with a knife in his chest, pulled it out, and called 911. Smith later died in the hospital and a possible suicide note was found. The autopsy report left open the possibility of homicide, although Smith's death was reported as a suicide. Smith's remains were cremated and divided among his mother, father, and half-sister. There was a small memorial service held for family and friends, but his ashes were not present. Record producer Larry Crane had planned to help Smith mix his album shortly before his death and expressed disbelief at the timing. The autopsy found no illegal substances or alcohol in Smith's system, but prescribed antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications were present. The investigation into Smith's death remains open."

ad38cc903265cfa5dcf582ec8dc8194c,William_H._Prescott,The cause of death was a second stroke.,"William H. Prescott was an American historian who is known for his influential works on the history of Spain and the Americas. His meticulous use of sources and critical notes set a new standard for American historians. His most famous works include ""The History of Ferdinand and Isabella,"" ""The Conquest of Mexico,"" and ""The Conquest of Peru."" While his works were highly regarded during his time, modern scholarship has identified some flaws, such as a focus on major political and military events rather than social and economic conditions, and a weak understanding of Inca and Aztec culture. Prescott's biographers have been known to romanticize his life and there is a popular misconception that he was completely blind. Prescott's paradigm, which argued that Spain's decline was a result of religious bigotry and political despotism, was influential in American historiography but began to decline in the 1990s. Prescott has been honored with the naming of the City of Prescott in Arizona, the William H. Prescott House (Headquarters House), and Colegio Anglo Americano Prescott in Peru."

His aircraft disappeared from radar and was not reported missing for nearly a day due to limited radar coverage in Panama at the time. The crash site was located several days later and Torrijos' body was recovered. Four aides and two pilots also died in the crash. Torrijos' death caused national mourning in Panama. He was succeeded by Florencio Flores and later Ruben Dario Paredes. There have been allegations and speculation of an assassination plot surrounding Torrijos' death. Some believe that the United States was involved in his death, and in 1991, Manuel Noriega's attorney claimed to have documents showing attempts to assassinate both Noriega and Torrijos by U.S. agencies. The Soviet news agency TASS also claimed that the U.S. was responsible for Torrijos' death. Colonel Roberto Diaz, Torrijos' cousin and a former Noriega chief of staff, has accused the United States and Noriega of involvement in Torrijos' death."

In 1564, he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, rumored to be in penance for dissecting a living body. He was shipwrecked and died on the island of Zakynthos, where he was buried. The assumption that his pilgrimage was due to pressure from the Inquisition is now considered unfounded. It is believed he used it as a pretext to leave the Spanish court so he could continue his research."

In particular, his novella ""Home to Roost"" (originally known as ""Nero Wolfe and the Communist Killer"") and his novel ""The Second Confession"" expressed his strong dislike for communism. However, paradoxically, Stout also arranged for the firing of a virulently anti-Communist broadcaster, comparing him to Hitler and Mussolini. Despite the controversy, Stout continued writing until his death on October 27, 1975, at the age of 88, at his estate located on the New York/Connecticut border."

She had gathered evidence of safety violations and nuclear contamination at the plant and decided to go public with this information. She contacted a journalist from The New York Times and arranged to meet him in Oklahoma City. However, on the way to the meeting, Silkwood's car ran off the road and she was found dead at the scene.

Other possibilities include schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.","Schumann's mental health declined, with visions of angels being replaced by demonic ones. In 1854, he attempted suicide by jumping into the Rhine River but was rescued. He was then admitted to an asylum and remained there until his death in 1856. It is believed that his symptoms were consistent with mercury poisoning or a brain tumor. There are also hypotheses that he had syphilis, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder. After his death, Clara continued her career as a pianist and became the editor of his works. It was rumored that she and Brahms destroyed some of Schumann's later works, but only the Five Pieces for Cello and Piano are confirmed to be destroyed.

However, in 1950, an astrologer noted that the sum of Schoenberg's age and birthdate equaled 13 and warned him that the year was critical.

Trotsky was still popular, but he was excluded from decision-making. The troika, led by Stalin, made all key decisions. The Left Opposition, which was dissatisfied with the party regime, began to form and criticized the troika. Economically, the Left Opposition supported faster industrialization, while the ""Right"" group supported the troika. In terms of world revolution, Trotsky and Radek predicted stability in Europe, while Stalin and Zinoviev predicted an acceleration of revolution. Ideologically, Trotsky believed the Soviet Union needed a world revolution to create a true socialist society, while Stalin believed in building socialism in one country. The troika showed signs of weakness, and Trotsky published a book that criticized Zinoviev and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power. This led to a new round of struggle within the party. Trotsky's opponents criticized his differences with Lenin, his alleged distortion of the events of 1917, and his treatment of subordinates during the civil war. Trotsky was forced to resign from his positions, but he retained his Politburo seat on probation."

She wanted to escape to Vienna to continue her singing lessons and marry a man from Linz, but Hitler forbade it. On September 18, 1931, they argued about her plans, and the next day, she was found dead from a gunshot wound in Hitler's apartment. There were rumors of physical abuse, a possible sexual relationship, and even murder. The police ruled it a suicide, and Hitler was devastated, going into a deep depression. He later declared that Geli was the only woman he had ever loved. Different theories have been proposed about her death, including speculation that Hitler accidentally or intentionally killed her during an argument."

Peel's personal secretary, Edward Drummond, was mistakenly killed instead. This event led to the establishment of the ""insanity defense"" in criminal law. One of the notable acts of Peel's second ministry was the repeal of the Corn Laws, which were protectionist measures that restricted grain imports to support agricultural revenue. Peel made this radical move in response to the Great Irish Famine, despite skepticism from his own party. The bill passed with support from Whigs and Radicals, but Peel's Irish Coercion Bill was defeated. As a result, Peel resigned as prime minister in June 1846."

In 1921, Enver initially planned to return to Anatolia but ended up going to Moscow and winning the trust of the Soviet authorities. He was then sent to Bukhara to suppress the Basmachi Revolt but instead defected to the Basmachi side. He aimed to unite the Basmachi groups and launch an offensive against the Bolsheviks to achieve his pan-Turkic dreams. After successful military operations, he became the supreme commander of the rebels. However, on August 4, 1922, he was killed during a surprise attack by the Red Army. There are conflicting accounts of his death, with some stating he was killed during a cavalry charge and others claiming he was ambushed and killed by machine gun fire. His body was buried in Tajikistan but was later brought to Turkey and reburied in Istanbul in 1996. Enver Pasha's reputation in Turkey is controversial, with his memory being cultivated by the Kemalists but also praised by President Erdoğan during recent events in Nagorno Karabakh. In 2023, Azerbaijani officials renamed a street in Stepanakert after him."

Ben Kiernan estimates that between 1.671 million to 1.871 million Cambodians died, which is about 21% to 24% of the population in 1975. Another study by Marek Sliwinski estimates slightly fewer than 2 million deaths out of a population of 7.8 million. The most widely accepted estimates range from 1.5 million to 2 million excess deaths, with 500,000 to 1 million deaths due to executions. However, a 2013 academic source suggests that executions may have accounted for as much as 60% of the total deaths, with 1.3 million suspected victims in mass graves. Demographer Patrick Heuveline estimates that between 1.17 million and 3.42 million Cambodians died unnatural deaths between 1970 and 1979. The estimate of 3.3 million deaths provided by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime is considered an exaggeration. It is also mentioned that around 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980 due to the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policies."

The Tomarkens were volunteers for Angel Flight West, a nonprofit organization that offers free air transportation to medical patients in need.

She was riding home from a neighbor's house when she was ambushed and shot multiple times. It is said that she was shot with her own double-barrel shotgun. According to one account, her death was the result of a confrontation with Edgar J. Watson, one of her sharecroppers who was intoxicated. Watson had asked Belle to dance, but when she declined, he followed her and shot her near a creek where she had stopped to give her horse a drink. Watson was tried, convicted, and executed for her murder. However, another story suggests that no one was ever convicted and there were no witnesses to the crime. Possible suspects included Belle's new husband, her children, and Watson himself, who had a price on his head as an escaped murderer. The murder remains unsolved, and it has been suggested that Belle's son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her horse, may have been the killer."

He left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848. During his exile, he participated in gambling and business ventures in the hopes of becoming wealthy. He was also a passionate cockfighting enthusiast and would enter his roosters into competitions with cocks from around the world. In the 1850s, López de Santa Anna traveled to New York City with a shipment of chicle (a substance derived from sapodilla trees), intending to sell it for use in buggy tires. However, he was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that it could be a suitable material. Though he introduced chewing gum to the U.S., López de Santa Anna did not profit from it. Instead, Thomas Adams, an American assigned to assist him, experimented with chicle and helped found the chewing gum industry with a product called ""chiclets."" In 1865, López de Santa Anna attempted to return to Mexico to offer his services during the French invasion, but he was refused by Juárez. Later that year, he was brought to Staten Island by Gilbert Thompson, where he tried to raise money for an army to retake Mexico City. In 1874, López de Santa Anna returned to Mexico after a general amnesty was issued, but he was crippled and almost blind from cataracts.

However, he became increasingly ill in 1979 and was admitted to the Medical Center in Ljubljana. His refusal to have his left leg amputated eventually led to his death from gangrene-induced infection in 1980. Tito's state funeral drew many world leaders and was one of the largest in history at that time. He was interred in the House of Flowers mausoleum in Belgrade."

A crowd gathered at the Piazza del Campidoglio and began rioting even before his death. They decapitated his statue and threw it into the Tiber. They also freed prisoners and attacked the offices of the Inquisition, killing the Inquisitor and destroying their records. The crowd attacked the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva but were dissuaded from burning it down. They removed the Carafa family coat of arms from buildings in the city. Modern historians view Paul IV's papacy as poor, characterized by personal prejudices and an adversarial nature. After his death, his body was taken to the Cappella Paolina and then the Sistine Chapel. His nephew, Cardinal-nephew Carlo Carafa, had him buried without ceremony for fear of the rioters desecrating the corpse. His remains were eventually transferred to Santa Maria sopra Minerva."

He was imprisoned in the castle of Vilvoorde near Brussels where he continued working on his translations and writing treatises. Despite the Church's influence, heresy was viewed as sedition and could result in the death penalty. Tyndale spent a year and a half in prison and engaged in a theological debate with his Inquisitor. Eventually, he was tried on charges of Lutheran heresy and found guilty. He was executed by strangulation and then his body was burned. Tyndale's final words were a plea for the King of England to open his eyes. Within four years of Tyndale's death, several English translations of the Bible were published based on his work."

Rees, he upheld Kentucky's method of lethal injection but expressed his belief that state-sanctioned killing was becoming outdated. Stevens' decisions on the death penalty were influenced by DNA testing revealing the fallibility of death sentences and the biases of death-qualified juries.

Treadwell was known for his love and fascination with bears, but Huguenard was reported to fear bears and feel uncomfortable around them. They set up camp near a salmon stream where bears commonly feed in the autumn, even though it was later in the year than usual, and food was scarce causing the bears to be more aggressive. They had originally planned to leave the park at their usual time but decided to stay for an additional week after an argument with an airline. Treadwell filmed the bears and the last footage shows his discomfort around a particular bear. In October 2003, Treadwell spoke with an associate on the phone and mentioned no problems with bears. The next day, a pilot arrived at their campsite to pick them up but found it abandoned except for a bear. Upon investigation, their mangled remains were discovered. Treadwell's head, spine, forearm, and hand were recovered, while Huguenard's partial remains were found near the torn tents. A large male bear protecting the campsite was killed by park rangers, along with an adolescent bear that charged at them. The attack was recorded on a video camera, with audio capturing screams and cries as Treadwell was being attacked.

They were allegedly involved in the killings of mob bosses Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano, which solidified Luciano's rise to power. Luciano and Lansky then formed the National Crime Syndicate, an organization that united crime families. Siegel formed Murder, Inc. with Lansky, but eventually control was given to Buchalter and Anastasia. Siegel only had one conviction for gambling and vagrancy in Miami. He had a dispute with the Fabrizzo brothers, who had made an assassination attempt on him and Lansky. After killing the Fabrizzos, Siegel discovered that Tony Fabrizzo had planned to write a memoir about Siegel's nationwide kill-for-hire squad. In order to prevent this from being executed, Siegel killed Tony Fabrizzo in 1932. In 1935, Siegel helped Luciano ally with Dutch Schultz and killed loan shark brothers Louis ""Pretty"" Amberg and Joseph C. Amberg."

b522b9725edb885eb8e032ba1b557e13,Jack_Parsons,Cause of death: Explosion,"Jack Parsons and his wife, Cameron, were planning to travel to Mexico before eventually moving to Israel. Parsons had a job opportunity to establish an explosives factory for the Mexican government and hoped this would help him bypass the US government to restart his career in rocketry. Parsons was paranoid about being spied on by the FBI. On June 17, 1952, a day before their departure, an explosion occurred in Parsons' home laboratory while he was working on a rush order of explosives. Parsons sustained fatal injuries and died shortly after reaching the hospital. The Pasadena Police Department investigated the incident and concluded that Parsons had dropped a can of fulminate of mercury, causing the explosion. Some colleagues disagreed, suggesting foul play. The police found insufficient evidence to investigate further and ruled the death as accidental. Some speculated that Parsons had committed suicide due to depression, while others believed it was an assassination. Parsons' death attracted media attention, initially focusing on his contributions to rocketry but later discovering his involvement in occult practices. Parsons' ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert, and both a private prayer service and a memorial service led by the O.T.O. were held in his honor. The exact cause of his death remains unresolved."

49ddf0f94dadb0145e74656f95f85a10,Wallis_Simpson,The cause of death was bronchial pneumonia.,"Wallis Simpson died on April 24, 1986, at the age of 89 from bronchial pneumonia. Her funeral was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and was attended by members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. Wallis was buried next to her husband, Edward, in the Royal Burial Ground near Windsor Castle. Wallis had originally planned to be buried in a cemetery plot in Baltimore, but an agreement with Queen Elizabeth II led to her burial in England. In recognition of France's help to the Windsors, Wallis's collection of furniture, porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, raising $45 million from the sale of her jewelry collection. Mohamed Al-Fayed purchased much of the non-financial estate, including the lease of her Paris mansion and later auctioned it off for charity."

He was buried in Berlin and posthumously received the Deutscher Orden (""German Order""). There have been suggestions that Todt's death was an assassination orchestrated by Hitler, possibly because Todt had recommended suing for peace with Russia. Todt's successor was Albert Speer, who was supposed to be on the same plane but had declined to travel. Speer mentioned a Reich Air Ministry inquiry into the accident, which concluded that sabotage was ruled out. However, Speer found the wording of the conclusion to be curious."

He had been pursuing a Sopwith Camel piloted by Canadian pilot Wilfrid Reid ""Wop"" May. Richthofen's cousin, Lieutenant Wolfram von Richthofen, had been attacked by May, prompting Richthofen to come to his rescue. Richthofen chased May across the Somme and was briefly attacked by Canadian Captain Arthur ""Roy"" Brown. Richthofen turned to avoid Brown's attack and continued pursuing May. It was during this pursuit that Richthofen was hit by a bullet through the chest, causing severe damage to his heart and lungs. His aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed in a field near Vaux-sur-Somme. Witnesses found Richthofen dead at the scene, with injuries to his face from the impact. The Australian Flying Corps assumed responsibility for his remains, and his aircraft was eventually taken apart by souvenir hunters. In 2009, Richthofen's death certificate was found, which confirmed that he died from wounds sustained in combat."

The court gathered information from witnesses that implicated Rommel in a conspiracy, and Keitel and Guderian shifted the blame onto Rommel. Normally, Rommel would have been brought to a kangaroo court and executed, but Hitler feared the impact it would have on morale and offered Rommel the chance to take his own life instead. Rommel chose suicide and was given a cyanide capsule. His death was officially reported as a heart attack or cerebral embolism, and Hitler ordered a day of mourning and a state funeral. The truth behind Rommel's death became known to the Allies through interviews with his family members. Rommel's grave is located in Herrlingen, and veterans of the Africa campaign continue to gather there in his memory."

Rule was a professor at the University of British Columbia and they became Canadian citizens in 1960. Despite being a prominent figure in the gay community, Rule shocked some by opposing gay marriage, arguing that it reinforced heterosexual norms. In 1976, Rule and Sonthoff moved to Galiano Island, where they were well-liked and known for lending money to residents in need and teaching children how to swim. Rule battled chronic arthritis as she grew older and was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2007. She opted for no radical treatment and continued to live her life until her death later that year. Rule's ashes were interred next to Sonthoff's in Galiano Island Cemetery. Her memoir, Taking My Life, was published posthumously in 2011."

The Los Angeles Police Department reported that the incident occurred between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. in the upstairs bedroom of his home. Reeves' fiancée, Lemmon, and some party guests were present at the time. Lemmon initially claimed to be in the living room with the guests, but hearsay statements from a friend of Reeves suggested she may have been inside or near the bedroom.

Leutnant Karl Thom, Leutnant Christian Donhauser, and Sergeant Carl Graeper all claimed credit for the kill, but the true identity of Quentin's killer remains uncertain.

Delores Tucker also sued Shakur's estate, claiming that his lyrics in certain songs caused emotional distress and invaded her privacy. However, the case was eventually dismissed."

It mentions an interview with Mies van der Rohe and focuses on the discussion of design philosophies, architectural projects, and the relationship between architecture and city planning. It also mentions Mies van der Rohe being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. The postmodern motto ""less is a bore"" is introduced as a counter to Mies' motto ""less is more"" coined by Robert Venturi in 1966. The text discusses the renewed interest in Mies' designs with advancements in architectural glass manufacturing, and the influence of his work on the minimalism movement and fusion with Japanese architecture. Mies van der Rohe died in 1969 from esophageal cancer caused by smoking, and his ashes were buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. It concludes by stating that while Mies' work had significant influence and recognition, it was overshadowed by the new wave of Post Modernism in the 1980s."

Peirce was not widely recognized during his lifetime, but later scholars such as Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead, and Karl Popper hailed him as a great thinker. John Dewey and Morris Raphael Cohen were among the first scholars to study and promote Peirce's work. The publication of the first six volumes of Peirce's Collected Papers in the 1930s did not immediately prompt further studies, but the Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Peirce's reputation grew, and he is now considered an influential figure in pragmatism and American philosophy. He has gained an international following, with research centers and scholars devoted to his work in various countries. Peirce's trichotomy of signs is also used in marketing and design. John Deely sees Peirce as the last of the moderns and the first of the postmoderns, comparing him to Augustine as the last of the Western Fathers and the first of the medievals."

Her partner, Ahmed Hasni, claimed they had gone to see a movie and when he woke up the next morning, Seberg was gone. Hasni told police that Seberg had been suicidal and had previously attempted suicide by jumping in front of a train in July of that year. Nine days after her disappearance, Seberg's decomposing body was found in the backseat of her car, parked near her apartment. Police found a bottle of barbiturates, an empty water bottle, and a note from Seberg addressed to her son, expressing her inability to live with her nerves. Initially, her death was ruled a probable suicide, but the following year charges were filed against unknown individuals for not assisting a person in danger. Seberg's second husband, Romain Gary, held a press conference blaming the FBI for her mental health decline, claiming that the false reports planted by the FBI that she was pregnant with a Black Panther's child in 1970 had caused her to become psychotic. Seberg is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris."

Shakespeare's will is mentioned, with most of his estate being left to his daughter Susanna. He was buried in the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford, and a monument was erected in his memory.

Wanted posters were put up all over the country with a price on Stern's head. He moved from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, eventually staying in an apartment rented by members of Lehi. One of his contacts, Hisia Shapiro, thought she was being followed and stopped bringing him messages. The Haganah, another Zionist paramilitary organization, offered to house Stern if he would give up his fight against the British, but he declined and suggested cooperation between Lehi and Haganah instead. British detectives searched the apartment and found Stern hiding there. The circumstances of his death remain disputed, with the police claiming he was shot while trying to escape and others believing he was shot in cold blood. Stern's son and grandson have since become media personalities in Israel."

7a166210cb89ccc1a75f5398bd0eaa50,Thelonious_Monk,Stroke,"Thelonious Monk disappeared from the music scene in the mid-1970s due to health reasons. He made only a few appearances in the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings were made in November 1971. During a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, Monk hardly communicated with his bandmates, later attributing it to their ugliness. Monk's biographer, Lewis Porter, describes him as someone who constantly talks about music and is willing to explain it in great detail. Monk was also known for his skill in playing chess and checkers. A documentary suggests that Monk's eccentric behavior may have been caused by mental illness, as his son reports that he sometimes didn't recognize him. Monk was hospitalized multiple times for an unspecified mental illness that worsened in the late 1960s. Doctors recommended electroconvulsive therapy, but his family declined and he was instead prescribed antipsychotics and lithium. There are conflicting theories about Monk's diagnosis, with some doctors suggesting misdiagnosis and potential brain damage from medications. In his final years, Monk was taken care of by his patron Pannonica de Koenigswarter and his wife Nellie. He did not play the piano during this time and spoke to very few visitors. Monk passed away from a stroke on February 17, 1982, and was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York."

19e2162345452b8471e3d54f27406888,Lee_Harvey_Oswald,The cause of death: Gunshot.,"In 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald used the alias ""A. Hidell"" to purchase a rifle and a revolver by mail order. The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald attempted to kill retired U.S. Major General Edwin Walker in April 1963 and fired the rifle at him through a window, but only caused minor injuries. The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations also believed Oswald carried out the shooting. General Walker was an advocate against communism and segregation, and Oswald considered him the leader of a ""fascist organization."" Marina Oswald testified that her husband told her he shot at Walker. Prior to the Kennedy assassination, the police had no suspects in the Walker shooting, but Oswald's involvement was suspected soon after his arrest. Ballistics analysis suggested that the bullet used in the Walker shooting was likely made by the same manufacturer and for the same rifle as the bullets that struck Kennedy. George de Mohrenschildt and his wife recalled seeing Oswald's rifle in his apartment and joking about the shooting. This was the last time they saw the Oswalds."

Newton was a bachelor and had given away much of his estate to relatives before his death, so he died intestate. His papers were passed on to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. A plaster death mask was made of Newton shortly after his death and used to create a sculpture. The mask is now held by the Royal Society, who created a 3D scan of it in 2012. Posthumously, it was discovered that Newton's hair contained mercury, likely from his experiments with alchemy. This could explain his eccentric behavior later in life."

The Privy Council ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels, and Marlowe's colleague Thomas Kyd was arrested. A heretical tract belonging to Marlowe was found, and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Marlowe presented himself to the authorities but was instructed to give his daily attendance. On May 30, Marlowe was killed in a dispute over payment. Various accounts of his death emerged, including claims of him being stabbed to death in a drunken fight or killed by a bawdy serving-man as punishment for his ""epicurism and atheism"". The official coroner's report stated that Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye and killed instantly. Some have disputed the authenticity and accuracy of the report, suggesting that Marlowe's companions were unreliable witnesses. The true circumstances of Marlowe's death remain unknown."

He and his wife Alma returned to New York in late October, where Mahler had a busy season of concerts and tours with the Philharmonic. Mahler began experiencing a sore throat around Christmas 1910, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, despite having a temperature of 40 °C, he insisted on performing at Carnegie Hall. This turned out to be his last concert. Mahler was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis and spent weeks confined to bed. He expressed hope of resuming the concert season and showed interest in Alma's compositions being performed. However, on 8 April, Mahler and his family left New York for Europe, and he was admitted to a clinic in Paris. With no improvement, he was then transferred to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he developed pneumonia and slipped into a coma. Mahler died on 18 May 1911.

He began to question the doctrine of transubstantiation and turned to studying the Holy Scriptures. Dissatisfied with the answers he received from other theologians, he decided to rely solely on Scripture and described his preaching as ""evangelical"" rather than ""sacramental."" In 1531, he learned about and was initially skeptical of the concept of rebaptism. Through further study and discussions with his pastor, Menno came to believe that infant baptism was not supported by the Bible. He encountered Anabaptists while serving in Witmarsum and was drawn to their zeal and their views of the Bible, the Church, and discipleship. In 1535, Menno's brother was killed in a violent takeover of a Catholic monastery by Anabaptists. This event, along with a personal spiritual crisis, led Menno Simons to pray for grace and forgiveness from God."

Boyle. Miners were unhappy with Boyle's leadership and felt that he was more interested in protecting mine owners' interests than those of the union members. Grievances filed by the union took a long time to resolve, leading to local unions resorting to wildcat strikes to resolve disputes on their own. In 1969, Joseph ""Jock"" Yablonski challenged Boyle for the presidency and although Boyle won the election, Yablonski alleged fraud and asked for an investigation. Yablonski, his wife, and daughter were subsequently murdered, and it was revealed that Boyle had ordered the killings. This led to a reform movement within the UMWA. In 1972, it was concluded that the election was fraudulent.

By 1733, around 125 Newcomen engines were installed in various mining areas in Britain and Europe, under Savery's patent."

Godse held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting on a payment to Pakistan. The death and funeral of Gandhi helped consolidate the authority of the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress party tightly controlled the public displays of grief, with millions participating in various events. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimize the Congress party's control, and suppress religious paramilitary groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed several groups and made numerous arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral helped link the state with the Indian people and emphasized the need to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence. There was later a revisionist school of history that blamed Nehru for the partition of India. Between 1947 and 1950, the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union. The Government of India Act 1935 remained the constitutional law until the adoption of a new Constitution in 1950, which declared India a sovereign democratic republic."

112d7fcc34a35d3adfdd4547868e1990,Friedrich_Nietzsche,The cause of death was complications from strokes.,"This text provides a summary of the events surrounding Friedrich Nietzsche's mental breakdown and subsequent decline in health. Nietzsche experienced a breakdown in January 1889 and was brought to a psychiatric clinic in Basel by his colleague Jacob Burckhardt. He was later transferred to a clinic in Jena. Despite efforts to treat Nietzsche's condition, his mental illness worsened, and he was eventually cared for by his sister Elisabeth in Weimar. After his mother's death in 1897, Elisabeth took control of Nietzsche's works and published them. Nietzsche's health continued to deteriorate, and he suffered strokes in 1898 and 1899. He died in August 1900, and Elisabeth arranged for his burial. She also compiled and published Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks under the title ""The Will to Power,"" but many scholars consider it to be a forgery."

Four months before Munson's death, there were concerns among Yankees executives about his piloting skills and attempts were made to get him to stop flying. On August 2, 1979, Munson was practicing takeoffs and landings at Akron-Canton Regional Airport with his flight instructor Dave Hall and friend Jerry Anderson. During the final landing, Munson failed to extend the flaps and allowed the aircraft to sink too low before increasing engine power. This caused the jet to clip a tree and fall short of the runway, resulting in a crash. Hall and Anderson survived with injuries, but Munson was trapped and died from asphyxiation. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to Munson's failure to recognize the need for proper airspeed and power application during an approach without flaps, as well as his nonstandard pattern procedures. Munson was not wearing a shoulder harness restraint, which contributed to the severity of his injuries. Anderson credited Munson for saving their lives by keeping the aircraft under control until the last moment."

He was also diagnosed with an inoperable liver cancer called undifferentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, which required a liver transplant. Mantle received the transplant on June 8, 1995. However, controversy arose because some people believed that Mantle received the donor liver quickly due to his fame, bypassing patients who had been waiting longer. Mantle's doctors insisted that the transplant was based on medical criteria, but acknowledged the appearance of favoritism. In July, Mantle addressed his fans in a press conference and urged them not to be like him as a role model. He also established the Mickey Mantle Foundation to raise awareness for organ donations. Later, it was discovered that the cancer had spread throughout Mantle's body, and doctors believed that the anti-rejection drugs given to him for the liver transplant had accelerated the cancer's growth."

She tried to keep her illness private, but the tabloid press started making fun of her appearance, prompting her to go public. Despite claiming a full recovery, the treatments caused her to lose most of her hair, leading her to sometimes wear a wig which she would take off casually in public. In 2005, she was reported to be critically ill and suffered from balance problems due to radiotherapy. She fell and sustained head injuries on July 30, 2005, and never regained consciousness. Her living will, in which she did not want to be resuscitated, was honored, and she passed away on August 19, 2005, at the age of 55. Her death came shortly after the death of another cabinet minister, Robin Cook. It was later revealed that her tumor had been malignant and was the cause of her death, which she had kept a secret from Tony Blair and the electorate. Mowlam was an atheist and had a non-religious funeral service conducted by Richard Coles. Her ashes were scattered at Hillsborough Castle and her former parliamentary constituency of Redcar."

55c034ac6a6deb45e713d44ffbc3abd6,Robert_Maxwell,Cause of death: Heart attack and accidental drowning.,"On November 4, 1991, Robert Maxwell had a heated phone call with his son Kevin regarding Maxwells's default on £50,000,000 in loans from the Bank of England. The next day, Maxwell went missing while on his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, off the coast of the Canary Islands. It has been speculated that he fell overboard while urinating into the ocean, as he often did. His naked body was later recovered from the Atlantic Ocean with only a graze to his left shoulder. The official ruling was death by a heart attack combined with accidental drowning, although the cause of death was debated at the inquest. Murder and suicide were ruled out. Maxwell received a lavish funeral in Israel attended by dignitaries and politicians. His former head of security had tapes stored in a suitcase that were discovered later and revealed Maxwell's increasing paranoia about his employees."

After giving a talk in the morning, he was found dead later in the day in his cottage. He was wearing only shorts and had a short-circuited fan lying across his body.

The Primate of the Benedictine order anointed Merton's body before it was flown back to the United States. In 2018, a book was published suggesting that Merton may have been assassinated for his opposition to the Vietnam War. Another book presented evidence of manipulation and cover-up by the Catholic Church and Merton's political opponents."

His lawyer reported that Morsi spoke for seven minutes before the session was adjourned, and he collapsed a minute later. Morsi was buried in Cairo alongside other Muslim Brotherhood figures. Critics blamed the conditions of his trial for his death and accused the Egyptian government of premeditated murder. A British parliamentary panel had previously expressed concerns about Morsi's health and the lack of medical assistance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called Morsi a martyr and blamed the Egyptian leadership for his death. The Egyptian government imposed censorship on coverage of Morsi's death, with newspapers ordered to use a brief account with no reference to his presidency or allegations surrounding his death. Most newspapers complied, except for Al-Masry Al-Youm, which mentioned his presidency on their front page."

He developed catarrh, which led to bronchitis and pleurisy, ultimately causing his death in London on March 14, 1883, at the age of 64. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery in an area for agnostics and atheists. There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral, including Friedrich Engels, Eleanor Marx, and other close friends and family members. Several speeches were given, including one by Engels, and telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain were read out. Marx left a personal estate valued at £250, and when Engels died in 1895, he left a significant portion of his estate to Marx's surviving daughters. In November 1954, Marx and his family were reburied at a new site in Highgate Cemetery, with a tomb bearing the message ""Workers of All Lands Unite"" and a quote from The Communist Manifesto. The monument was erected by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and activist Claudia Jones was later buried beside Marx's tomb. Marx's writings had an impact on left-wing movements in Germany and Russia, leading to significant gains in representative democratic elections within twenty-five years of his death."

cdd403fcf316436f0335dc9bb28e559a,Edvard_Munch,There is no information provided about a specific cause of death.,"This text discusses the exhibition of Munch's work in Berlin in 1893, which included six paintings titled Study for a Series: Love. This marked the beginning of a larger series called the Frieze of Life, which focused on themes of life, love, and death. The Frieze of Life included motifs such as The Storm and Moonlight, which created a certain atmosphere, as well as motifs that explored the darker side of love, such as Rose and Amelie and Love and Pain. The painting Death in the Sickroom portrayed the death of Munch's sister Sophie, and he later created multiple variations of this piece. Munch continued to expand the range of motifs in the Frieze, adding artworks like Anxiety, Ashes, Madonna, and Women in Three Stages. Munch used the Frieze of Life themes throughout his work, exploring topics such as the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, and separation in life and death. Munch's artwork often depicted women as either innocent sufferers or the cause of longing, jealousy, and despair. He used techniques such as shadows and rings of color to create an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. Munch also turned to graphic arts to reproduce his paintings and make income. He saw his art as a way to express his relationship with life and hoped it would help others achieve clarity. Munch faced negative reactions to his work but also gained some understanding of his artistic goals, with critics acknowledging his intuitive strength in capturing visions of the soul. One of his supporters in Berlin was Walther Rathenau, who played a role in Munch's success."

It mentions his darkest album, Haackula, which inspired his final landmark work, Bite. Bite is described as harsher than his other works but still containing his educational touch. It also mentions the declining health of Haack and how Dimension 5, his label, continued to publish songbooks and re-release older albums. Haack's last recording was a collaboration with Def Jam's Russell Simmons, and he passed away in 1988. The text concludes by acknowledging that while Dimension 5's later releases may lack the same spark as the early records, they still show the deep friendship between Haack and his label collaborators."

Henry's writing career and personal life. O. Henry moved to New York City in 1902 and wrote 381 short stories, contributing to the New York World Sunday Magazine. Although his witty writing style and surprising plot twists were loved by readers, critics often criticized his work. In 1907, he married Sarah Lindsey Coleman, a writer who later wrote a fictionalized account of their courtship in her novella Wind of Destiny. O. Henry's health deteriorated due to heavy drinking, and Sarah left him in 1909. He died in 1910 from cirrhosis of the liver, complications of diabetes, and an enlarged heart. His daughter, Margaret Worth Porter, also pursued a writing career but passed away from tuberculosis in 1927.

Plath's grave was vandalized by those who disagreed with Hughes' name being on the stone, and there were accusations of battery and murder against him.

Six years after Plath's death, his partner Assia Wevill also died by suicide, along with their four-year-old daughter. These deaths led to further allegations of abuse by Hughes."

By 1959, Holiday was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and had relapsed into drinking despite her doctor's orders. Her friends and manager attempted to convince her to go to the hospital, but she was eventually admitted in May for liver and heart disease. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics had allegedly targeted Holiday since 1939 when she began performing the song ""Strange Fruit,"" but this claim is disputed. While in the hospital, narcotics police claimed to have found heroin in her bedroom and she was indicted, arrested, and handcuffed to her bed. After ten days in the hospital, her methadone was discontinued. Holiday received last rites on July 15 and died two days later at the age of 44 from pulmonary edema and heart failure caused by cirrhosis of the liver. She had been swindled out of her earnings and died with very little money. Holiday's funeral was held on July 21, 1959, and she was buried in the Bronx. Her status as a jazz icon grew in the following years, and she was posthumously nominated for multiple Grammy awards. Singer Adelaide Hall made a secret visit to Holiday's bedside at the hospital, which was confirmed by her spoken account captured on tape by journalist Max Jones in 1988."

The cause of the crash is uncertain, and several conspiracy theories have emerged over the years. The KGB's report, declassified in 2003, blamed airbase personnel for contributing to the crash by providing outdated weather information and leaving external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Another theory suggests that an open cabin air vent caused oxygen deprivation, leading to loss of control of the plane. In 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into Gagarin's death, and in 2011, declassified documents revealed that a commission originally concluded that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply, leading to the crash. Some believe that a Sukhoi Su-15 flying below its minimum altitude caused turbulence that led to the crash."

His death caused criticism and speculation. Historian Stephen Nissenbaum suggests that Graham violated his own dietary restrictions by consuming alcohol and meat in a final attempt to regain his health.

However, Graham regretted this decision before his death and still believed in the benefits of a vegetable-based diet. After his death, vegetarians distanced themselves from Grahamism. Nevertheless, his vegetarian message continued to be influential well into the 20th century. Graham is also recognized as one of the earliest food faddists in America."

Despite his deteriorating health, he remained cheerful and continued working on his painting ""The Bench"" with some assistance. On October 26, he received a letter from Benjamin Franklin and wrote a rough draft of a reply. That evening, he boasted about eating a pound of beefsteaks for dinner and appeared healthier than he had been in a while. However, he suddenly started vomiting before going to bed and rang the bell so forcefully that it broke. Hogarth died approximately two hours later in the arms of his servant, Mrs. Mary Lewis. The cause of his death was attributed to an aneurysm or a dropsy of his chest. Mrs. Lewis, who had been a loyal servant, was left £100 in Hogarth's will.

He received treatment from Saxton T. Pope, a professor of medicine at UCSF, who became a close friend. Pope learned how to make bows and arrows in the Yahi way from Ishi and they often hunted together. Ishi eventually died from tuberculosis. Before his death, Kroeber, a friend of Ishi who was in New York at the time, tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body in accordance with Yahi tradition, but Pope performed the autopsy anyway. Ishi's brain was preserved and his body was cremated, mistakenly believing it was the traditional Yahi practice. Ishi's remains, along with various items, were interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma, California. The preserved brain was sent to the Smithsonian Institution until it was repatriated to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes in 2000. His remains were also returned from Colma and the tribal members planned to bury them in a secret location."

Nicole Brown called him to report that her mother had left her reading glasses there earlier that evening. Despite not being their server, Goldman agreed to drop off the glasses at Brown's home after work. He left the restaurant at 9:33 pm and stayed for an additional 15 minutes at the bar. Before returning the glasses, he briefly stopped at his apartment and planned to go out with Mezzaluna's bartender later that evening. Goldman walked to Brown's condominium but was stabbed to death, along with Brown, on the walkway leading to her home. The police believe he arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death, and Goldman's family believes he died trying to save her. Goldman was killed 20 days before his 26th birthday and is buried in Westlake Village, California."

f098765159489e711a9481ff0a853ed3,Carlo_Gambino,Cause of death: Murder.,"In 1957, Genovese, a mob boss, planned to eliminate rivals Costello and Anastasia. He enlisted Gambino, Anastasia's underboss, to help with the murder plot. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to try to kill Costello, but the attempt only resulted in a minor injury. This incident convinced Costello to step down and hand power over to Genovese. Although Gigante was identified as the gunman, Costello claimed not to recognize him during Gigante's trial and he was acquitted. With Costello out of the picture, Genovese and Gambino allegedly ordered the murder of Anastasia. Gambino gave the contract to Profaci, who then assigned the hit to Joseph ""Crazy Joe"" Gallo. Anastasia was murdered in 1957 in a barbershop in Manhattan. Gambino took over the Mangano crime family and appointed Joseph Biondo as underboss. Biondo was later replaced by Aniello Dellacroce in 1965."

To address this, he relocated to the South to focus on the slave plantations he had acquired during the war. He made his home at the Mulberry Grove Plantation in Savannah. In 1784, he declined appointment to a commission but attended the first meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati. However, Greene fell ill in 1786 and died at Mulberry Grove at the age of 37. His remains were initially interred at Colonial Park Cemetery in Savannah but were later moved to a monument in Johnson Square. Greene was in debt due to difficulties in supplying his troops and had to pay off a debt himself. He sought relief from Congress for the outstanding money but received only a fraction of the amount owed. The plantation went to ruin and was sold for much less than its original value, resulting in Greene's representatives receiving significantly less money than expected. They later applied to Congress for the difference, but the case remained unresolved."

Gabčík attempted to shoot Heydrich with a submachine gun, but it jammed. Kubiš then threw an anti-tank mine at the car, causing an explosion that severely wounded Heydrich. Heydrich's driver chased Gabčík but was shot and wounded. A Czech woman helped Heydrich and he was taken to the hospital, but he ultimately died on June 4. The cause of death was determined to be sepsis, although other factors like pulmonary embolism and brain ischemia may have contributed. Heydrich was 38 years old at the time of his death."

Hudson traveled to Paris for treatment but eventually returned to Los Angeles, where he spent time at UCLA Medical Center before being released for hospice care at home. Hudson died on October 2, 1985, at the age of 59. His death brought attention to AIDS and led to increased funding for research. Hudson's revelation about his sexuality also sparked public discussion. After his death, more than $1.8 million was raised for AIDS research, and Congress allocated $221 million for a cure. Hudson made a $250,000 contribution to amfAR, a foundation for AIDS research and prevention, shortly before his death. The controversy arose concerning Hudson's participation in a kissing scene in the television show Dynasty, as he was aware of his AIDS diagnosis at the time. This revelation caused some panic in the industry, with scripts being rewritten and the Screen Actors Guild issuing rules regarding kissing scenes. Linda Evans, his co-star in the scene, was not angry at Hudson and even introduced a benefit dedicated to him."

Magda Goebbels wrote a farewell letter to her son Harald, who was in a POW camp. Joseph Goebbels added a postscript to Hitler's last will and testament, stating that he would not leave Berlin and that Magda and their children supported his decision. On April 30, Magda was among the last to see Hitler and Eva Braun before their suicide. On May 1, Magda and Joseph arranged for their six children to be injected with morphine and then given cyanide. It is debated whether Magda or SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger administered the cyanide. Magda had contemplated killing her children beforehand, refusing offers to smuggle them out of Berlin. Magda and Joseph Goebbels then committed suicide in the Chancellery garden. Their bodies were burned and partially buried, and the remains were later destroyed by the Soviet KGB in 1970."

Some biographers speculate that Handel traveled to Berlin at the age of 11 with a guardian or family friend, while others believe that Mainwaring may have combined multiple visits to Berlin into one. Modern biographers tend to accept the year 1698 based on older authorities, while questioning the accuracy of Mainwaring's account."

He got a job at a drugstore and eventually bought it. He also purchased an empty lot across the street and built a three-story building, which he called the ""Murder Castle.""

However, there is no evidence that he actually killed Exposition-goers on the premises. After Holmes' arrest, the building was partially destroyed by a fire but was later rebuilt and used as a post office. Holmes also owned a factory, which may have been used to destroy evidence of his crimes."

a4b45b223ae5cc0af9e1efd55ca667d1,Judy_Garland,The cause of death was an accidental barbiturate overdose.,"Judy Garland was found dead in the bathroom of her rented house in London on June 22, 1969, at the age of 47. The cause of death was determined to be an accidental overdose of barbiturates. There was no evidence to suggest that she had intended to kill herself. Garland had been living with cirrhosis, but a second autopsy found no evidence of alcoholism or cirrhosis. After her death, thousands of people paid their respects at her funeral in New York City. She was interred in a crypt at Ferncliff Cemetery in New York, but in 2017, her remains were moved to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. Despite her successful career, Garland's finances were mismanaged, resulting in her estate being in debt. Her daughter, Liza Minnelli, worked to pay off her debts. Some of Garland's personal items were auctioned off in 1978 to help raise money for her heirs."

42e7ff9cab6aad63c1d653e29f5d9e53,Gerald_Gardner,fatal heart attack,"Gerald Gardner, the founder of modern Wicca, had his official biography published in 1960. The book was written by Idries Shah but used the name of one of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, due to Shah's reluctance to be associated with Witchcraft. Gardner attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his service to the Empire, but shortly after his wife died and he began to experience health issues. In 1963, Gardner traveled to Majorca with Shah and Lois Bourne to spend time with the poet Robert Graves. In 1964, while returning home from Lebanon, Gardner suffered a fatal heart attack on a ship and was buried in Tunisia. His artifacts and the copyright to his books were left to one of his High Priestesses, but they were later sold off. Parts of his inheritance went to several individuals, with Jack Bracelin becoming the full-time High Priest of the Bricket Wood coven. Years later, Eleanor Bone discovered that Gardner's grave in Tunisia was to be redeveloped, so she raised money to have his body moved to another cemetery. In 2007, a new plaque was placed on his grave commemorating him as the ""Father of Modern Wicca."""

Only a few people attended Hilbert's funeral, including Arnold Sommerfeld, a theoretical physicist. The news of his death was not widely known until several months later.

The day before Hilbert made this statement, Kurt Gödel announced his incompleteness theorem, which showed that certain axiomatic systems are either self-contradicting or contain propositions that cannot be proven or disproven within the system."

The official ruling was suicide, but there are conflicting reports. According to a book assembled from manuscripts by Josephine Marcus Earp, Holliday and Wyatt Earp traveled to Arizona, found Ringo, and killed him. However, the authenticity of the book has been questioned, and it is considered a hoax. Another story from the movie Tombstone suggests that Holliday shot Ringo in response to a gunfight challenge. There is uncertainty about Holliday's whereabouts on the day of Ringo's death, with records indicating he appeared in court in Colorado around the same time and sightings of him in other towns. Additionally, there was an outstanding murder warrant for Holliday in Arizona, which makes it unlikely he would have returned there at that time."

Hooker died during the 1647 North American influenza epidemic and was buried in an unknown location, although it is believed to be in Hartford's Ancient Burying Ground.

In recent years, the city of Hartford celebrates Hooker Day in October with a parade where people dress up in costumes. The parade was suspended for some time but was revived in 2008 and continues to be held annually."

Her fortune had significantly diminished due to her generosity, including donating a property to the US government. Alleged questionable deals by her lawyer also contributed to her financial decline. Hutton began liquidating assets to support herself but still spent money on others. She spent her final years at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles and died from a heart attack in May 1979. Some sources claim she had only $3,500 left in her fortune, but there is disagreement among those who knew her. She was buried in the Woolworth family mausoleum in New York."

Garrett tried to break the lease when he learned that his neighbor, W.W. Cox, had put up the money for Brazel's operation. When Brazel refused, the matter went to court. A meeting was held with James B. Miller to try to solve the problem, and Brazel eventually agreed to cancel his lease if a buyer could be found for his herd of 1,200 goats. Carl Adamson agreed to buy the goats, but Brazel claimed there were actually 1,800 goats instead. Adamson refused to buy that many and a meeting was set up between Garrett, Adamson, and Brazel. During the meeting, Garrett was shot and killed. Brazel surrendered to Deputy Sheriff Felipe Lucero and claimed self-defense. Brazel was incarcerated, a coroner's jury was summoned, and a trial for Garrett's murder took place. Brazel was represented by Albert Bacon Fall and was acquitted, as the only eyewitness, Adamson, did not appear at the trial."

He began planning his last major work, The Glass Bead Game. Hesse observed the rise of Nazism in Germany and helped those in exile, working against Hitler's suppression of art and literature. Hesse's failure to publicly condemn the Nazi Party stemmed from his politics of detachment, as he believed in the opposite of what Nazism represented. In the 1930s, Hesse resisted by reviewing and publicizing the work of banned Jewish authors. German journals stopped publishing Hesse's work and the Nazis eventually banned it. The Glass Bead Game was his last novel, published in 1943. Hesse received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. In the last years of his life, he wrote short stories and poems and pursued his interest in watercolors. He died in 1962 and was buried in the cemetery of Sant'Abbondio."

177fc594d5c4a8a2a642236c99233374,Uday_Hussein,Uday Hussein's cause of death was gunshot wounds.,"Uday Hussein, the elder son of Saddam Hussein, fell out of favor with his father despite being his prospective successor. In October 1988, Uday murdered his father's personal valet and food taster, possibly at the request of his mother. This was due to the valet's introduction of Saddam to a younger woman who became his second wife, which insulted Uday's mother. Uday was briefly imprisoned as punishment for the murder and was then sent to Switzerland to serve as the assistant to the Iraqi ambassador there. However, he was expelled from Switzerland in 1990 after repeated arrests for fighting. Uday's vast car collections were reportedly burned by his father after the murder. There are also accounts of Uday's attempted suicide and his subsequent barricade of his home before surrendering with the persuasion of his brother. Uday then apologized to Saddam, who ordered him to surrender. After the incident, Uday attacked two people he believed to be informers and was sent to Switzerland to get rid of the disgrace caused by his actions. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt referred to Uday as a ""psychopath."""

Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Allies, but it ultimately failed. Hitler ordered the destruction of German industrial infrastructure and hoped to negotiate peace with the US and Britain, but this plan did not succeed. Hitler awarded Iron Crosses to Hitler Youth soldiers and made his last trip from the Führerbunker to the surface. The Red Army surrounded Berlin, and on April 30, Hitler shot himself in the head while his wife, Eva Braun, took cyanide. Their corpses were burned as Soviet shelling continued. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles, but they eventually committed suicide as well. Berlin surrendered on May 2. Hitler's remains were allegedly moved, but no identifiable remains were found. A death certificate was finally issued in 1956."

The novel featured real-life figures, including Hellman and her partner Dashiel Hammett, as characters. The book received mixed reviews and was sometimes interpreted as part of Hellman's memoirs. Hellman's editor expressed concerns about a reviewer trying to fact-check the novel, arguing that it was a work of fiction where characters misremember and deceive. In 1983, a psychiatrist named Muriel Gardiner claimed to be the inspiration for the title character in Hellman's book Julia, but Hellman denied it. Some critics suggest that Hellman might have used Gardiner's story without giving credit. Hellman died in 1984 from a heart attack near her home in Martha's Vineyard and was buried there."

53abac7f3bc372df9a37351a042807ec,Joseph_Grimaldi,The cause of death is unknown.,"Joseph Grimaldi retired from the stage in 1823 due to his deteriorating health, which was caused by years of physical strain from his clowning act. He suffered from joint pain and a respiratory condition that left him breathless. Even after retiring, he still received half of his previous salary until 1824. However, he fell into poverty due to failed business ventures and being cheated by those he entrusted with his earnings. Despite his disabilities, he made cameo appearances in Christmas pantomimes and gave acting instruction to other performers. He worked briefly for Richard Brinsley Peake but had to quit due to his declining health. Grimaldi's retirement, financial stress, and concerns about his son's future led to increased depression. In 1828, two farewell benefit performances were held for him. He relied on charity benefits between 1828 and 1836 to supplement his income. The relationship between Grimaldi and his son became strained, with his son resentful of his father's success. His son, JS, became an alcoholic and was often unreliable. In 1827, JS returned home in poor health and faced unemployment and imprisonment. Grimaldi, Mary (his wife), and JS moved to Woolwich in 1832, but JS's behavior continued to cause problems. JS died in 1832. Grimaldi and Mary attempted suicide but failed. Mary died in 1834, and Grimaldi spent his final years alone as a depressed alcoholic. He died on May 31, 1837, and was buried in St. James's Churchyard, Pentonville. The burial site was later named Joseph Grimaldi Park."

The directors and stockholders of Union Pacific used the profits from the construction company to buy Union Pacific stock at par value and sold it on the open market for more profit. Durant renamed the company Crédit Mobilier of America. The scandal involving discounted Credit Mobilier stock sold to Congressional members voting for expensive railroad construction costs was uncovered during the Grant administration.

He hanged himself using an extension cord in a summer house in the prison garden. A note thanking his family was found in his pocket. The Four-Power Authorities ruled his death a suicide. Initially, he was buried at a secret location to avoid media attention, but his body was later re-interred in a family plot. Hess's son and lawyer believed that he was murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. However, an investigation by the British government concluded that there was no evidence to support this claim. Autopsy results supported the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. There were later questions raised about his death, with some suggesting he may have been murdered, but these claims were not substantiated. Hess's grave became a site for neo-Nazi pilgrimages, leading to its closure in 2011. Eventually, his remains were cremated and scattered at sea. Spandau Prison, where Hess was held, was demolished in 1987 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. In 2019, DNA testing confirmed the identity of the prisoner as Hess."

3b58fb51c2307b84bae4d60359a6539a,Enver_Hoxha,Hoxha died from a heart attack.,"This text provides a summary of the political events and policies during the rule of Enver Hoxha in Albania. Hoxha accused his Minister of Defence, Beqir Balluku, of being an agent of China and attempting a coup d'état. Balluku and his associates were sentenced to death and Hoxha appointed Mehmet Shehu as Minister of Defence. The Seventh Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour decided on a new Constitution that emphasized self-reliance and banned borrowing and foreign investment. Albania became isolated from other countries in Europe. Hoxha executed several party and government officials in purges and his closest comrade-in-arms, Mehmet Shehu, was reported to have committed suicide. Hoxha wrote numerous books during this period. He suffered from various health issues and died in April 1985. After his death, Ramiz Alia succeeded him as head of state. Hoxha left Albania with a legacy of isolation and economic stagnation."

He had a troubled personal life, suffering from chronic alcoholism and troubled relationships. Despite this, he and his band remained popular and benefited from the 1950s nostalgia movement. Haley was diagnosed with a brain tumor and his planned tour of Germany had to be cancelled. There were plans for a biographical film or autobiography, but his behavior began to change due to the tumor. Haley's alcoholism worsened and he began to exhibit signs of serious mental health issues. He was frequently picked up by police for intoxication and was hospitalized, but ultimately continued his downward spiral. He died at his home from natural causes, most likely a heart attack, at the age of 55. Haley was cremated in Texas."

3fa2017b9811c64651aa77f80727f101,Nikolai_Gogol,The cause of death was deep depression and self-inflicted starvation.,"After the success of his novel Dead Souls, Gogol was seen by his contemporaries as a satirist who criticized the darker aspects of Imperial Russia. However, they did not know that Dead Souls was only the first part of a larger planned work inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy. Gogol intended for the second part to depict the redemption of the main character, Chichikov, through encounters with virtuous individuals. In 1848, Gogol returned to Russia from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and spent his final years traveling throughout the country. During this time, he became close with a spiritual elder who reinforced his fear of damnation and engaged in ascetic practices that negatively impacted his health. In 1852, Gogol burned some of his manuscripts, including most of the second part of Dead Souls, which he claimed was a mistake orchestrated by the Devil. He subsequently fell into a deep depression and died nine days later. Gogol was mourned and buried at the Danilov Monastery, but his remains were later transferred to the Novodevichy Cemetery by communist authorities in 1931. There are conspiracy theories suggesting that Gogol may have been buried alive. His original grave marker, known as the Golgotha stone, was moved to the new gravesite, but the cross was removed. The statue of Gogol erected in Moscow after the October Revolution changed several times due to different political ideologies. The original statue now stands in front of the house where Gogol died."

Berlin was ill-prepared for a defense, with little fortifications or artillery, and German forces were in short supply. Goebbels considered making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler refused. He opposed the idea of leaving Berlin and instead advocated for a last stand. Goebbels and his family moved into a bunker in Berlin. As the Soviets advanced closer to the bunker, Hitler married Eva Braun, dictated his last will and testament, and then shot himself. Goebbels refused to comply with Hitler's order to leave Berlin and decided to stay with him until the end. On May 1, Goebbels arranged for his children to be injected with morphine and then administered a cyanide compound. He and his wife, Magda, then killed themselves in the garden of the Chancellery. The bodies were partially burned and not buried, and in 1970, the remains were destroyed by the Soviet KGB."

Lincoln's secretaries, John Hay and John Nicolay, expressed their desire for different jobs. Shortly after Lincoln's second inauguration in March 1865, Hay and Nicolay were appointed to the US delegation in Paris. Hay stated that the appointment was unexpected, but it is suggested that his close relationship with Secretary of State William H. Seward may have influenced the decision. Hay and Nicolay also wanted new jobs due to their deteriorating relationship with Mary Lincoln and Nicolay's desire to marry. Hay was not with the Lincolns at Ford's Theatre on the night of Lincoln's assassination, but he stayed at the White House with Robert Lincoln. When they learned of the President's shooting, they rushed to the boarding house where Lincoln was taken and Hay stayed by his deathbed until he died. Lincoln's assassination was a personal loss for Hay, and he believed Lincoln to be a great character. Hay would spend the rest of his life mourning Lincoln and felt that Lincoln was always watching over him."
